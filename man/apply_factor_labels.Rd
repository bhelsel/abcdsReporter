\title{Apply Factor Labels from the ABC-DS Codebook}
\usage{
apply_factor_labels(data, dictionary)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataset existing in the user's global environment for which
to apply factor labels.}

\item{dictionary}{A data dictionary (e.g., returned by \code{\link{get_codebook}})
from the ATRI EDC containing the field names and coded values.}
}
\value{
A data frame in which coded character or numeric variables are converted
to factors with labeled levels according to the ABC-DS codebook.
}
\description{
Converts coded variables in a dataset into factors with meaningful levels
and labels, as defined in the ABC-DS codebook retrieved from the ATRI EDC.
}
\details{
The \code{apply_factor_labels()} function parses coded response options
stored as JSON within the data dictionary and applies them to the
corresponding variables in the dataset.

For multi-select fields such as \code{de_race}, the function handles
delimited responses (e.g., \code{"1|2|3"}) through \code{split_factor_labels()}.
