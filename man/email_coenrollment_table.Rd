\description{
Retrieves ABC-DS coenrollment data from the ATRI Electronic Data Capture (EDC)
system using \code{\link{create_coenrollment_table}} and emails the formatted
table to a specified list of recipients.
}
\details{
This function automates the process of generating and distributing the
ABC-DS coenrollment table. It first calls
\code{\link{create_coenrollment_table}} to retrieve and format the table as
a \code{\link[gt]{gt}} object, then converts it to HTML using
\code{\link[gt]{as_raw_html}} before embedding it in an email body.

The email is sent using \code{\link{send_email}}, which must be properly
configured with SMTP settings and recipient information.
