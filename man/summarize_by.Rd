\title{Summarize a Variable by Groups}
\usage{
summarize_by(
  data,
  variable = NULL,
  groups = c("site_initials", "site_label", "event_label"),
  stats = c("mean", "median", "sd", "min", "max")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing the variable and grouping columns.}

\item{variable}{The numeric variable to summarize (unquoted).}

\item{groups}{A character vector of column names to group by. Defaults to
\code{c("site_initials", "site_label", "event_label")}.}

\item{stats}{A character vector of statistics to compute. Options include
\code{"mean"}, \code{"median"}, \code{"sd"}, \code{"min"}, \code{"max"}.
Defaults to all five.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[tibble]{tibble}} containing one row per group combination and
columns for each requested statistic, with names in the format
\code{<stat>_<variable>}.
}
\description{
Computes summary statistics for a numeric variable grouped by one or more
categorical variables. Supports common statistics including mean, median,
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.
}
\details{
The function constructs a formula of the form \code{variable ~ group1 + group2 + ...}
and applies each requested statistic using \code{stats::aggregate}. Results
are then merged together using \code{atri_join} to produce a single tibble.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Compute mean and sd of 'de_score' by site and event
summarize_by(demo_data, variable = de_score, stats = c("mean", "sd"))
}
}
