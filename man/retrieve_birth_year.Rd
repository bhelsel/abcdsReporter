\title{Retrieve Year of Birth from ABC-DS Data}
\usage{
retrieve_birth_year(data, site = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataset containing participant identifiers and associated
demographic information from the ABC-DS study.}

\item{site}{Optional. A site code or name used to filter results to a specific
study site; defaults to \code{NULL}, returning data from all sites.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[tibble]{tibble}} with participant identifiers and corresponding
year of birth values.
}
\description{
Extracts and formats participantsâ€™ year of birth from the ABC-DS dataset,
optionally filtering by site. The resulting dataset can be merged with
other study data or used for age calculations.
}
\details{
The \code{retrieve_birth_year()} function retrieves the variable representing
year of birth from the ABC-DS demographics data and converts it into a clean,
analysis-ready format.

This function is typically used internally by \code{\link{get_demographics}}
to calculate participant age at visit using the evaluation date
(\code{de_eval_date}). However, it can also be called independently when
users need access to year-of-birth data for custom analyses or data merging.

  # Retrieve year of birth for a specific site
